Simple-Langchain-App-with-Google-Gema-Model
This project demonstrates how to build a simple LangChain-powered application using the Gemma:2B model. It leverages LangChain’s modular components for model integration, prompt engineering, and interaction.

With this application, you can:
✅ Load and run the Gemma:2B model efficiently.
✅ Generate responses from the LLM using structured prompts.
✅ Implement memory and retrieval-based interactions (optional).
